# TeslaTools
Speedrunning tools for Teslagrad.
One program to group all tools developped by the Teslagrad speedrun community.

## TeslaSplit (Not implemented yet)
This tool watches the Teslagrad save game files looking for updates. New saves are made upon entering a room, killing a boss, collecting an item, etc. Upon encountering a key event you're anticipating, it will press the split hotkey for your timesplitting program. This allows hands-free and consistently accurate split times.

## Save Editor (Not implemented yet)
This tool creates customisable saves directly into the Teslagrad save folder. Usefull for NG+, and also a good way to practice on particular moment of the game.

## Bingo (Work in progress)
This tool generates bingo cards for bingo races. The bingo will be made of different objectives like collecting specific scrolls and killing or not bosses. Maybe performe specific tricks or just gimic thing like killing a certain amount of voidwalker/grue. 

## TASlasgrad (Work in progress)
This tool records inputs and then play them back whenever you want for TASing or multi-segment purpose. Curently has major de-sync issue.
